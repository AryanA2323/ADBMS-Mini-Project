# MongoDB Atlas - Books Collection CRUD Operations Summary

## ✅ All Components Connected to LMS.Books Collection

Your Library Management System is now fully integrated with MongoDB Atlas. All CRUD operations work with the same **Books** collection in your **LMS** database.

### 🔗 API Endpoints Overview
All frontend components use these backend endpoints:

#### **Update Operation (Update)**
```
Update Page → PUT /api/books/:id → Books.save() → LMS.Books Collection
```

- Record deleted from MongoDB Atlas

### 🏗️ Database Structure
```
MongoDB Atlas Cluster: LMS
└── Database: LMS
    └── Collection: Books
        └── Documents: {
            _id: ObjectId,
            BookID: String (unique),
            BookTitle: String,
            BookAvailability: String,
            BookPrice: Number,
            BookAuthor: String,
            createdAt: Date,
            updatedAt: Date
        }
